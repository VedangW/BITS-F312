    "### Processing Natural Langauge Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most active fields for Deep Learning research today, and RNNs are the core technology behind most popular NLP applications today.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to feed language data into any kind of neural network, we need to change words into some appropriate numerical representation. This is easier said than done. Only the part of the data that captures the crux of what we want the network to learn needs to be kept. All redundant information needs to be discarded and the remaining needs to be converted to numerical representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Words can be converted to numbers using a bunch of methods, most popular of these being [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf) and [GloVe](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: These papers might be quite difficult to understand for anyone not familiar with NLP. These methods will be briefly described in the lab. Look at the references at the end of this demo for blog articles for easier understanding.\n",
